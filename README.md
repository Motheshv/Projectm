<h1>Smart Parking System – Phase 3</h1>
Welcome to Phase 3 of the Smart Parking System project. In this phase, we will guide you through the setup and code implementation for integrating an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Uno and transmitting the collected data to a Raspberry Pi for further processing and integration with cloud and mobile applications.

## Arduino Setup
## 1.Connect HC-SR04 to Arduino Uno:
To set up the HC-SR04 sensor, follow these connections:

Connect the VCC pin of the HC-SR04 sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the GND pin of the HC-SR04 sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino Uno.
Connect the Trig pin of the HC-SR04 sensor to a digital output pin (e.g., D2 on Arduino).
Connect the Echo pin of the HC-SR04 sensor to another digital input pin (e.g., D3 on Arduino).
Refer to the following image for a visual representation of the Arduino setup:

           
## 2.Arduino Code:
Before you proceed, ensure you have the “NewPing” library installed in your Arduino IDE. Then, upload the following Arduino code to read data from the HC-SR04 sensor and send it to the Raspberry Pi via Serial communication:
  #include <NewPing.h>
#define TRIG_PIN 2
#define ECHO_PIN 3
#define MAX_DISTANCE 200
NewPing sonar(TRIG_PIN, ECHO_PIN, MAX_DISTANCE);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  delay(1000);  // Adjust the delay as needed
  unsigned int distance = sonar.ping_cm();
  Serial.println(distance);
}

This Arduino code initializes the HC-SR04 sensor and sends the distance measurements to the Raspberry Pi through a serial connection.

## Raspberry Pi Setup
## 1.Connect Raspberry Pi to Arduino Uno:
Establish a connection between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno using a USB cable for serial communication.

## 2.Install Serial Communication Libraries:
On your Raspberry Pi, install the necessary libraries for serial communication using the following command:

 sudo apt-get install python-serial

## 3.Python Code for Data Handling:
Create a Python script to read data from the Arduino over the USB serial port and forward it to the cloud or a mobile app server. Below is a basic Python script to get you started:

 import serial
ser = serial.Serial(‘/dev/ttyACM0’, 9600)
   
# Optionally, open a file to log the data
log_file = open(‘sensor_data.log’, ‘a’)
   
while True:
    try:
        data = ser.readline().decode().strip()  # Read data from the Arduino
        
        # Optionally, log the data to a file
        log_file.write(data + ‘\n’)
        log_file.flush()
   
        # Send data to a cloud or mobile app server
        # Implement the server communication according to your specific requirements.
        print(f”Received data from Arduino: {data}”)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        ser.close()
        log_file.close()
        break

## Conclusion
This README serves as a solid starting point for implementing Phase 3 of your Smart Parking System. Remember to customize the code and integration process according to your unique project needs and the specifications of your chosen cloud platform or app server.
